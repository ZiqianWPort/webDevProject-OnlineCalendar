### Creative portion:

1. Users can tag their events with three options: work, home, school. These tags can be added when the event is created or afterwards. If the user wants to edit the events' tags, they can go to the "edit" button at the right side of the events' box to add or remove tags from the event. 

2. Users can share their events with other users by entering others' user id when adding or editing an event. To do so, they simply need to enter another user's ID in the text box following "Share Event to (optional):" . The system will make a copy of the selected event and place it in another user's calendar based on the specified user id. The events sent from one user to another will have a mark on their title that specifies the user id of the sender. One's user id can be found on the top-left corner of the screen alongside their username. 

3. Users can see the time measured in "hour:minute" at which they entered the website at the right-bottom side of the calendar. Everytime the user refreshes the website, the time will be refreshed as well. This design allows users to check their local time with the calendar website when adding events. 

4. The calendar is displayed in such a way that, the user will click on the date they wish to check on the calendar to see the events in it displayed as a list positioned below the calendar. In comparison to the traditional way of restricting the event cards in a small grid on the calendar, this design decision enables users to scroll through a list of events more comfortably as the event cards occupy a larger area of the screen.
